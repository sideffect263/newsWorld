# Global News & Data Aggregation Platform

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive web platform that collects, processes, and presents global news and data from various sources. The platform will provide users with a centralized hub for accessing diverse news content and data visualizations from around the world.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Collection Infrastructure

  - Scheduled API requests (hourly/daily updates)
  - API key management and request rate limiting

- **RSS Feed Aggregation**
  - Parser for major news outlets' RSS feeds
  - Scheduled feed checking and content extraction

- **Web Scraping Pipeline** (for sources without APIs)
  - Python-based scrapers (BeautifulSoup/Scrapy)
  - Proxy rotation and user-agent cycling
  - Respect for robots.txt and ethical scraping practices

- **Official Data Sources**
  - Government portals, UN data, WHO statistics
  - Economic indicators from World Bank, IMF
  - Climate data from scientific organizations

  - Popular content identification
  - User behavior analysis

- **Recommendation System**
  - Personalized content suggestions
  - Related articles linking
  - Topic-based content discovery

### 4. Frontend Application

- **Web Interface**
  - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Next.js/React-based frontend
  - Server-side rendering for SEO optimization

- **User Experience**
  - Customizable news feed
  - Advanced filtering options (region, topic, source)
  - Dark/light mode and accessibility features

- **Data Visualization**
  - Interactive maps showing news distribution
  - Charts and graphs for statistical data
  - Timeline views for developing stories

- **User Features**
  - Bookmarking and reading history

### 5. Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Cloud Architecture**
  - Containerized microservices (Docker)
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

- **Scaling Strategy**
  - Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
  - Database sharding for growing content
  - CDN for global content delivery

- **Monitoring & Maintenance**
  - Performance monitoring and alerting
  - Error tracking and reporting
  - Regular security audits

### 6. Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Content Attribution**
  - Clear source citation for all content
  - Compliance with fair use guidelines
  - Proper licensing for redistributed content

- **Privacy & Data Protection**
  - GDPR and CCPA compliance
  - Transparent data collection policies
  - User consent management

- **Content Moderation**
  - Fact-checking procedures
  - Misinformation detection
  - Community reporting system
